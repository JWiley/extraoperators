Description: Speed up common tasks, particularly logical or
  relational comparisons and routine follow up tasks such as finding the
  indices and subsetting. For example, it implements
  a chaining operator, inspired by standard mathematics, where something like:
  3 < x < 6 is standard, elegant and clear way to assert that
  x is both greater than 3 and less than 6
  (see for example <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_operator>).
  extraoperators allows "x is greater than 3 and less than 6" to be
  implemented as x %c% "> 3 & < 6". To further speed up assertions,
  for example that all values in x are greater than 3 and less than 6,
  any of the binary operators can be prefixed with "a", like:
  x %ac% "> 3 & < 6".
