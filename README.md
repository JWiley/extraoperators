```

Overview
--------

The table below summarizes what this package provides. Fundamentally
it provides or expands on 14 different logical operators, which can be accessed on
their own to return a logical vector, but also prefixed by `?` (which)
to return the **indices** that are `TRUE` or prefixed by `s` (subset)
to return only those **values** that are `TRUE` or prefixed by `a`
(all) to return a single logical value, are ALL true? An entire all
logical comparison can be prefixed by `!` to generate a NONE
evaluation.

Using these ten operators, you can accomplish many different tasks by
just remembering the additional prefixes: `?` for `which()`, `a` for
`all()` and `s` for `subset()`. While simple, this can save quite a
few keystrokes and make various logical comparisons less convoluted.
